# LSA-Email-Template-Full
This is the single-column email communication template provided by the College of Literature, Science and the Arts department of Marketing and Communications. This template is designed and developed by the department of Marketing and Communications and leverages the [Cerberus fluid email template](https://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/).

This file requires some basic HTML knowledge in order to use. At the very least, you will need to provide a header image, footer image, and body copy in the HTML code.

Images are currently local references. If you want to load the image from a CDN (our web drive, for example) you will need to provide the image href properties.

## Features
- Single-column layout.
- 600px width fluid design. Will resize content on screens smaller than 600px.
- Header and footer placeholder.
- Fully commented code.
- Component driven design. Copy and paste provided code blocks to add different components.

## How to Use
1. Click the green **Clone or Download** button and select the **Download ZIP** button.
2. Change the header image.
3. Change the footer image.
4. Change the body copy.
5. If you're using Campaign Monitor
- Test
6. If you're using Mail Chimp
- Test

### OPTIONAL
- Add hidden preview text

## Changelog
### v1.0
- Initial file creation. Modified Cerberus fluid email template to coincide with LSA marketing and branding standards. Inbox tested and fully vetted.
